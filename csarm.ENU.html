    <p>New behaviour in <code>assert()</code> (new in 7.10.1)<br/>
      The <code>assert()</code> function will now launch a dialog box, letting the user choose Abort, Debug, or Ignore.<br>
      If the old behaviour is wanted, then add the following to your application source code:</p>
      <pre><code>void __aeabi_assert(char const * msg, char const *file, int line)
{
  printf( "%s:%d %s -- assertion failed\n", file, line, msg );

      C-SPY in IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM comes with an improved mechanism and 
      configuration scheme for the flash loader function. An existing project that employs a flash
      loader with a legacy configuration, will be automatically migrated to the new scheme with
      default settings. The default settings will in most cases be sufficient. Old settings are converted
      to a new configuration file (with the extension <code>.board</code>) and may be used if the
      default settings are not appropriate. Read more about the new mechanism and configuration
      scheme for flash loaders in the <a href="../FlashLoaderGuide.ENU.pdf">Flash Loader Guide</a>.

        registers <tt>R8_USR</tt> to <tt>R14_USR</tt> do not always contain correct values. This makes the

        <p>Current limitations in the MTB (Micro Trace Buffer) implementation for I-jet</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The Trace Start/Stop/Filter breakpoints are not supported in MTB.</li>
        <li>The timestamps for MTB trace records come from a simple counter and have no relation to
        CPU/clock cycles. Any conversion between cycles and time for MTB trace data will be misleading. The
        Call Stack graph in the <b>Timeline</b> window, for example, should not be used to measure time
        intervals.</li>
        <li>The MTB trace data sequence might not present discontinuities correctly. Lines in the <b>ETM
        Trace</b> window (also used for MTB trace) might be marked as discontinuous (colored red), even
        though the trace sequence is contiguous. Conversely, trace data from a buffer that has overflowed
        will not always be marked as discontinuous. This is mostly a cosmetic problem, except for the Call
        Stack graph in the <b>Timeline</b> window, which only displays the latest continuous sequence of
        trace data.</li>
        <li>The <b>ETM Trace</b> window and related windows are used for all variants of full instruction
        trace, ETM, ETB, and MTB.</li>

        C-SPY accesses Freescale Vybrid flexbus address range before the flexbus clock is enabled. This
        causes a bus error which makes the cpu unresponsive.
        A workaround is provided in EWARM 6.60.2:
        Excluding the address range for J-Link with a C-SPY macro and with a memory configuration change for
        I-jet will prevent reads from the flexbus address range.

    Two new debugger command line options are available for the I-jet debug probe. They can be used

    <p><code>

      Use this option to disable the PMU DAP channel and revert to using CP15 instructions for PMU event 
      counting. <br>
      This disables live updating of counter values when the debugger is running.

    <li><p><b>AP0_Memory - AP5_Memory</b>: Shows ports 0 through 5.</p></li>

    The behavior of the access to these zones might be unpredictable when the selected port does not exist,
    is not a MEM-AP architecture, or if it is inaccessible for other reasons.<br>

    At the moment, these zones are only accessible when using the C-SPY I-jet driver, or the C-SPY CMSIS-DAP driver.

    To use XDS100v2, select <b>TI XDS100</b> in the <b>Driver</b> drop-down list on the

    If an external editor was used in the IDE, it was also used in the debugger.
    This could make it impossible to set breakpoints in the source code.
    Now the debugger always uses the built-in editor.<br/>
    [EW19591]
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
   If the simulator executed a tight loop containing illegal instructions, it
   would flood the debug log window with error messages and the IDE would
   hang. This has been corrected.<br/>

   J-Link, RDI, JTAG: The disassembly window made accesses to the VICAddress register etc. (0xFFFFFF00 - 0xFFFFFFFF )
   when displaying the interrupt vectors at 0x00-0x20. This led to that no IRQs were triggered any more.<br>

     There are also two new corresponding ways to restart the debugger during the debug session.

  <p>
  <li><b>Loading multiple ELF images</b><br/>
    The debugger can load multiple ELF images using the C-SPY macro <code>__loadModule()</code>.
  </li>
  <p>
  <li><b>Symbols window</b><br/>
     The Symbols window displays the complete list of symbols used within the project.
     In contrast to the Source Browser, the list of symbols is not based
     on project source files but is retrieved from the debug information.
     This means, that it also lists symbols from libraries that you do not have the source for.
     It also lists assembler labels, which are not conveniently visible in any other window.

    You can now&nbsp;set or clear a breakpoint 
    by&nbsp;double-clicking in the left margin of the editor window; the breakpoint 
    location is marked by a red X. If there is more than one possible breakpoint
    location in the source line, the breakpoint is placed on the first location.<p></p>

    If, during a simulation, execution reached unallocated memory, a new
    memory block would be allocated and filled with zeros. Then the
    execution would continue in this block, since 0x0 is a valid
    instruction in both ARM and Thumb mode. The execution would continue,
    potentially until the memory runs out on the host machine. This has
    been fixed. Now the simulation stops and an error message is displayed
    whenever the program reaches memory that has not been allocated. The
    simulator allocates memory in 16 Kbyte blocks. If the error message
    "Tried to execute instruction in unallocated memory space, address
    <code>0xXXXXX000</code>" is displayed, the execution did go wrong in the 16
    Kbyte block before <code>0xXXXXX000</code>. Then it continued until it
