      <div>
        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>New plug-in version for IAR EWARM 9.10.1.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Memory allocation issue fixed.<br>
            When debugging an application that did not contain any embOS task, the plug-in could exhaust all allocatable memory.
            The problem existed in versions 6.10.3.6, 7.10.3.6, 7.50.3.6, 8.10.3.6, and 8.30.3.6 and is fixed with versions 6.10.3.7, 7.10.3.7, 7.50.3.7, 8.10.3.7, and 8.30.3.7.

      <div>
        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The plug-in may now be configured to activate when a user-defined function gets executed on the target. This may be used to avoid accessing target memory e.g. during segment initialization, during the execution of a bootstrap loader, etc.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Plug-in settings are now saved to and restored from the Windows registry and thus are permanent between debug sessions.</li>

      <div>
        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Big endian support for Renesas RX added<br>
            In previous versions of the embOS plugin the task sensitive call stack did not work with Renesas RX CPUs running in big endian mode.
            With the embOS plugin version V6.0.4 RX is supportd in little and big endian byte order.
          </li>
          <li>
            Manual updated, task sensitivity explained.<br>
            The new manual revison 6 now explaines the task sensitive call stack, register window and source window which is available for several CPUs.

      <div>
        <h3>New Features</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Update for new IAR EW-RX V2.10<br>
            The new IAR Embedded Workbench V2.10 for Renesas RX CPUs comes with a modified debug engine which required modification of the embOS plugin for RX.
            The older version 3.82.2 of the plugin which was initially built for the EW-RX can not be used.
            All plugin-versions V6.0.x can be used, but the task sensitive call stack does not work with these versions.
            The new embOS RX-Version 3.82g is required for the new IAR EW-RX 2.10 and task sensitive call stack.

            The new embOS plugin V6.0.2 for IAR C-Spy and RENESAS SH2A targets now shows the state and call stack of all tasks. Every task in the task list, even suspended or interrupted tasks, can be analyzed during a debug session.
            An embOS version 3.82f or later of embOS for SH2A is required for task sensitivity.

            Update for new IAR workbench V6<br>
            The new IAR workbench V6 uses a modified SDK which requires an updated embOS plugin for IAR C-Spy.
            The new embOS plugin V6 can be used with the new IAR workbench V6. It is based on the previous plugin V3.82.2 and supports all features of the previous versions.

      <div>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Plugin useable when target application was not downloaded to target.<br>
            Previous versions of the plugin did not show the task list and system information, when embOS version 3.80 or later was used and the target application was not downloaded into the target.
            This might have happened, when the debugger option &quot;Attach to program&quot; was used.
            This problem is fixed with version 3.82.1 of the plugin.

      <h2>Version 3.82.0 [07. Oct 2009]</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Memory read error with J-Link fixed.<br>
            Previous versions of the plugin might have produced a memory read error when debugging a connected hardware with external data memory.
            The problem occurred when the external data memory was not accessible directly after downloading into the target memory.
            During initialization, the plugin tried to read some variables from the data memory which failed, as long as the access to the external memory was not initialized by the target application or debug macro function.
            The problem existed in all previous versions of the plugin and is corrected with version 3.82.0.

            Complete task awareness for RENESAS M16C and R8C cores.<br>
            The new embOS plugin V3.80.3 for IAR C-Spy and RENESAS M16C or R8C targets now shows the state and call stack of all tasks. Every task in the task list, even suspended or interrupted tasks, can be analyzed during a debug session.
            An embOS version 3.80l or later of embOS for M16C is required for task sensitivity.

      <div>
        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Display of suspended tasks corrected.<br>
            Previous versions of the plugin did not show the &quot;suspended&quot; state of a task in the task list.<br>
            The problem existed in all previous versions of the plugin and is corrected with version 3.80.2.
          </li>
          <li>
            Display of task states of tasks waiting with timeout corrected.<br>
            Previous versions of the plugin did not show the task state when a task was waiting on any object like an Event object, a mail box or a task object with timeout.
            The timeout value was shown, but the task state was not shown in the task list.
            The problem existed in all previous versions of the plugin and is corrected with version 3.80.2.
          </li>
          <li>
            Current task was not marked in the task list.<br>
            The running task should be marked with a green arrow in the first column of the task list.
            When embOS version 3.80 or later was used, the arrow was positioned at idle always and did not mark the running task.
            The plugin version 3.80.2 positions the marker at the running task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Erroneous permanent update of debugger windows corrected.<br>
            When used with EW-ARM 5.30 or later, the plugin might have forced a window update of all debugger windows after restarting the application.
            This problem occurred when the call stack and task state of a suspended task was examined and the application was started without having the current task selected in the task window.
            The workbench could have crashed or raised an exception.
            The problem occurred when using EW-ARM 5.30 or later and is fixed with the plugin version 3.80.2.

            Complete task awareness for Cortex M3 cores.<br>
            The new embOS plugin V3.80.1 for IAR C-Spy and Cortex M3 targets now shows the state and call stack of all tasks. Every task in the task list, even suspended or interrupted tasks, can be analyzed during a debug session.
            An embOS version 3.62c or later of embOS for Cortex M3 is required for task sensitivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Support for new embOS versions 3.80 added.<br>
            embOS Version 3.80 or later with optimized internal data structures could not be used with the older version of the plugin.
            The task list and system variables were not shown. The new plugin V3.80.1 can be used with all versions of embOS.
          </li>

        <h3>Program corrections</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Display of embOS library mode corrected.<br>
            The older embOS plugin might have shown a debug and profiling library, even if only a debug library was used.
            The problem occurred, when an embOS version 3.32b or later was used.
            The new version 3.80.1 of the plugin shows the correct library mode.
